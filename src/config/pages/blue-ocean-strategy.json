Firms adopting BOS pursue simultaneous differentiation and low cost, breaking the traditional value‑cost tradeoff. In practice, this means seeking out untapped demand – new customers and market niches – so that \"competition is made irrelevant\". As one summary puts it, BOS focuses on \"achieving both uniqueness and low costs to create new market areas\" and generate demand rather than fight over it.\n\nLearn more about BOS: https://chatgpt.com/s/dr_6821c4b1ba808191934cf851b2cee6b7",

But even if things happen naturally, you still have to be prepared to catch the opportunity when it comes. I believe the best way to be prepared is to pay closer attention to life, ask more \"why not?\" questions, and turn those very personal and intimate dissatisfactions into the spark for your startup idea.",

But here's the thing: one of the main criticisms of blue ocean strategy is how easy it is to ignore real competition. The entrepreneurial world is wild and ever-changing. A lot of brilliant founders start by solving a super niche pain point—just like you—and they also pivot and grow. So just because your startup is in a \"blue ocean\" now doesn't mean it'll stay that way. There will always be potential competitors lurking, ready to make a move. So technically, it's wrong to assume your market is a \"safe\" blue ocean forever.",

The service of Offer Studio is basically helping students applying to U.S. colleges to make personal websites, and websites for activities, charity projects, and entrepreneurial projects. During the college application process, I was extremely busy with refining the Common App essay, supplemental essays, and the activities list. When my counselor told me about the necessity of creating a personal website, it was the last straw that crushed me. To save time, I wrote everything in the format of a document and paid a website-making company $400 to transform those contents into a website. They promised to give me the website in 2 weeks—still no message after 4 weeks. When I accessed their so-called \"finished version\" that they finally gave me after more than a month, I was so pissed because the website was a total piece of shit—looking like something made by a 10th-century barbarian. Not only was everything a mess and super ugly, they also misinterpreted a lot of things I wrote... There were only 2 days left until the application deadline. Then, I decided to do it myself. With years of experience using Wix, I made a wonderful-looking website in just one night without sleeping. And that tiredness and dissatisfaction with the service current companies offer is what made me determined to launch Offer Studio—our own service—right after I finished my college applications. Even if the current competitors exist on the surface level, I know that our service targets customers that are different in significant ways. This makes our service a relative blue ocean.",

Additionally, the polymer core with a fiber support structure also reduces cost, and improves lifespan and maneuverability.",
