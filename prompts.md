I am making a personal website using this json website builder I created. Help me write the config file for my home page. The site configuration file is @site.json . Create new pages in the src/config/pages folder.

The website consists of multiple pages with multiple sections. I would like my website to consist of the following content, formatted in a json file called form-data in the /Users/admin/Documents/GitHub/json-website-builder/src/config/form-data.json path. Use the mcp tool to retrieve info about it.  

Assets that are mentioned in this json can be found in the folder @media.

Style the personal homepage professionally. Make it pretty and visually appealing. Use beautiful and thematic font. Make sure that text coloring is not difficult to read.
